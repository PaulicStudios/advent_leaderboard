  # The job flow for the leaderboard is as follows:
  # - On November 20th, the leaderboard for that year will be set up.
  #   At this point, jobs will be enqueued to refresh it every 20 minutes.
  #   These jobs will not use cron, but will not be enqueued as far as they
  #   would end up in the past, so you can safely set up an older leaderboard,
  #   or the current leaderboard halfway through the month.
  # - Every day, the moment the current puzzle switches, a new day will
  #   be marked as active, telling the frontend which one to highlight.
  # - At the end of the month, all days will be marked as closed and the year
  #   will be marked as over, which will enable the frontend to show stats for
  #   the entire year when they are added.
